Contega is a .NET **Co**nsole **Te**tromino **Ga**me

The game mechanics are based on the popular Tetris game developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984.

Does the world need yet an other tetris clone? Probably not. This game is a programming exercise.
I will try to keep improving the code and keep adding features as long as it is fun to do.
